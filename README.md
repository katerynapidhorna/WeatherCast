### Assignment

Develop a simple frontend application using best practices that calculates the average temperature forecast of a city. The goal is to learn something new and as a result have a nice addition to your portfolio. The design is located here: [https://www.figma.com/file/AvW3g7PArmDFTYMp3TiTcb/Weather-app?node-id=6%3A212](https://www.figma.com/file/AvW3g7PArmDFTYMp3TiTcb/Weather-app?node-id=6%3A212)-
Follow the provided design. On top you will have the input, on the bottom the results with live reload.

- A user should be able to enter the name of a city and a 2-letter country code. The application will lookup the weather forecast of that city.
- The application then averages the forecasted temperature of the next 10 days.
- It also displays the temperature for the next 7 days with the day (Monday - Sunday) and the corresponding temperature.
- Also the background has a gradient where the end point is the color attached to the average temperature on the next 10 days.We prefer that you use Vue for this assignment. It is okay to use other frameworks, let us know if you do.It is important for us that you show what your code looks like and how you structure a project; what do you think are best practices? How would you store the weather data if your application would scale to a bigger application?We recommend using the Weatherbit API with a free account. In return we would appreciate a git repository, which could easily be shared with the technical team.
